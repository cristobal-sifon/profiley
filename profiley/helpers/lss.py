    Parameters
    ----------
    filename : str
        name of the file to be read. To ensure consistency, this file
        should have been created with ``save_profiles``; this is
        assumed but not checked
    x : iterable, optional
        quantities for which the profiles are needed. Each dimension
        must correspond to the columns storing the variables in the
        file (e.g., z and logm).
        Each column in ``x`` must be a unique array.
    precision : int or list of 2 ints, optional
        number of decimal places with which to match ``x`` to the
        columns read from the file.
    force_match_all : bool, optional
        whether if ``x is defined``, all values of x *must* be present
        in the file, otherwise a ``ValueError`` is raised.

    Returns
    -------
    profiles : ndarray, shape (M,N,P)
        grid of profiles
    R : ndarray, shape (P,)
